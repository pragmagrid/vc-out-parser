Parser for vc-out
-----------------
This script parses the vc-out.xml file and then it create the 
network configuration file used by RHEL based system.

In particular it creates the following files:

- /etc/resolv.conf
- /etc/sysconfig/network
- /etc/hosts
- /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
- /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1

On the frontend it will also deploy a 

- /tmp/machinefile
